    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Champions League</h1>
    <p style="color:black; font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by
        the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The
        competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a
        single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football
        competition overall, behind only the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. It is one of the most
        prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football,
        played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national
        associations.</p>
